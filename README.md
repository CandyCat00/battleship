# Overview

This is a program that allows the user to play Battleship in the terminal with an ascii grapic display(for now). So far, it is only meant for one player and that player does not make their own board. They simple choose they coordinates the want to shoot at gain feedback from the computer. Their goal is to clear the board before they run out of shots, or the computer wins. The user also has the ability to save their progress and reload it later.

This is a project I created to demonstrate and practice my recent learning of Java Language. As I learn more, I might come back and improve it as well.

# Development Environment

I developed this program entirely in visual studio code with the Java extention package provided by microsoft.

Uncoencidently, the code is written in the Java language. It also makes use of the Scanner, FileWriter, and FileReader library provided by Jave.

# Useful Websites

What I found the most useful in this project was actually an app, but they have a webiste too. They have a good curriculum that will run through the basics of almost any coding language.

# Future Work

Here are a few things I need to fix or add:
* Make it so typing a letter into any of the inputs doesn't crash the program
* create a way for the code to pull map set ups from a differnt file at random, to add more replayability. OR have the computer randomly make the maps itself with a certain set of rules.
* Better graphics.
